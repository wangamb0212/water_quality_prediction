# Water-Quality-Prediction

<h2>Description</h2>
This project predicts water quality in New York City's public drinking fountains located in parks to promote outdoor activities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We built and trained Random Forest, DNN, RNN, and LSTM models and found that the LSTM and RNN models outperformed others. The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods for water quality prediction and emphasizes the importance of public health aspects of climate change mitigation.
